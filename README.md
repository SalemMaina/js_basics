## ðŸ“˜ What's Inside

This repository is organized to reflect my learning journey. You'll find:

- ðŸ§  **Concept Tutorials**: Code snippets and examples of what Iâ€™ve learned (e.g. variables, functions, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, async/await, etc.).
- ðŸ”¬ **Mini Tests**: Small test scripts to explore specific features or behaviors in JavaScript.
- ðŸ’¡ **Mini Projects**: Fun projects that apply what Iâ€™ve learned (e.g. calculators, to-do lists, timers, simple games).
